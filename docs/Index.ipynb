    "When designing and performing experiments it is important to understand how your work fits in current scientific knowledge. This has traditionally been done by looking at the large body of literature. For sequencing studies we have the added benefit of large databases containing terabytes of worlds sequencing data. A worthwhile endeavor is to try to integrate these data into new experiments as they are performed. In order to do these types of analyses, data need to be summarized using similar processing pipeline and quality needs to be assessed. Here we this summarization for *Drosophila melanogaster*. "
