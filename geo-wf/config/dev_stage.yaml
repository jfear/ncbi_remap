# This YAML contains the mapping to developmental stage to a cleaned up
# vocabulary. This file is generated by hand. First I combined all attribute
# columns that appeared relevant to developmental stage and pulled out a unique
# list of their terms. I then went through by hand and mapped these trerms to a
# standard vocabulary.
